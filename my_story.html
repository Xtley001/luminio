        <h1>My Journey from Petroleum Engineering to Computer Science</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>It all started when I embarked on my journey in Petroleum Engineering, a field that promised stability
                and success. However, as time passed, I found myself at odds with certain aspects of the curriculum,
                particularly a math course that seemed to steer me off course.</p>
            <p>Despite my efforts, my result was released, and I ended up with a zero in the exam, which was unexpected
                given my very good continuous assessment score. All attempts to have it rectified proved unsuccessful, and
                eventually, I was advised to consider transferring to another program. The weight of that outcome was
                more than just the score—it made me question whether this path was truly where I belonged.</p>


            <h2>The Turning Point</h2>
            <p>It wasn’t easy to let go of a future that had been carefully planned for me. But after reflecting on what
                I truly wanted, I realized that my heart lay elsewhere – in the realm of technology, where my passion
                for problem-solving and creativity could thrive.</p>
            <p>Thus, I made the decision to transfer into Computer Science, a choice that aligned perfectly with my
                dreams and my talents. For the first time, I felt a sense of purpose and clarity. The world of tech
                beckoned, and I was ready to dive in.</p>

            <h2>Embracing My New Path</h2>
            <p>Now, as a Computer Science student, I have a clear goal in sight – to specialize in mobile development
                with Flutter. I want to create innovative applications that make machine learning accessible to users
                and bring real-world value to the world of mobile technology.</p>
            <p>Through my projects, I’ve explored the depths of mobile development, experimenting with different tools,
                frameworks, and algorithms. The process is both challenging and rewarding, and I can see how these
                projects will shape my future.</p>

            <div class="projects">
                <h3>My AI and ML Projects</h3>
                <p>Over the course of my journey in AI and machine learning, I’ve had the opportunity to work on several
                    projects that have shaped my understanding of the field and allowed me to apply my skills in
                    meaningful ways. Some of the projects I’ve worked on include:</p>
